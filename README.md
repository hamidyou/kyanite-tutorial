# Kyanite.js Tutorial

Created by [dhershman1](https://github.com/dhershman1), Kyanite.js is a light weight pure functional library with single type utility functions and it only depends on itself.

## Following along

You are encouraged to follow along and practice test the examples and create your own. Clone or fork and open the .js file and run using node. Just add a `console.log` and pass in any of the provided functions.

## More Info

This is a work in progress. If you see anything that needs changing, doesn't work as designed, or have any suggestions, feel free to let me know.
